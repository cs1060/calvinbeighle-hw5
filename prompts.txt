# Prompts used for SQL Injection Attack with Claude 3 Sonnet in Cursor

1. "Help me create a SQL injection attack for this endpoint: https://cat-hw4.vercel.app/county_data. It accepts POST requests with a JSON body containing zip and measure_name fields. Here's my test.json:
{
    'zip': '84601',
    'measure_name': 'Adult obesity'
}"

2. "The endpoint seems vulnerable to SQL injection through the measure_name parameter. Can you help me craft a UNION-based injection that would reveal table information?"

3. "I got an error about column count mismatch. Can you help me modify the injection to match the correct number of columns?"

4. "The injection worked! Now help me extract specific data about Utah County's health measures."

5. "Let's create the final attack.json payload that extracts all health measures for Utah County."
